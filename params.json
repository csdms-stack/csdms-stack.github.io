  "body": "### About CSDMS Stack\r\n\r\nCSDMS Stack is a GitHub organization that houses `conda` recipes. Each recipe builds a software package, which can be installed with the `conda` command, that together form the complete CSDMS software stack. There are two main types of repositories within the organization, each of which end with `-recipe`:\r\n\r\n1. _[model]_-recipe: These are recipes for community-contributed models.\r\n2. _[model]_-csdms-recipe: These are recipes for models that expose a BMI and that have wrapped so as they can be used within the CSDMS modeling framework, pymt.\r\n\r\nThe built distributions are upload to [anaconda.org/csdms](https://anaconda.org/csdms) and can be [installed with conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs). For example, to install a `csdms-stack` package into an existing conda environment,\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ conda config --add channels csdms-stack\r\n$ conda install <package-name>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contributing to CSDMS Stack\r\n\r\nYou can contribute to the CSDMS Stack in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. Report an issue with a particular recipe.\r\n2. Update an existing recipe.\r\n3. Add a new recipe.\r\n\r\n#### Report an issue with a package\r\n\r\n1. Search for the appropriate CSDMS Stack recipe.\r\n2. Search the issues for the recipe to make sure it hasn't already been raised and/or dealt with. If you don't find anything, create a new issue being sure to provide a detailed description of the problem, the result that our are getting and the result that you expect to get. In addition, please provide an example that reproduces your problem with the least amount of code possible.\r\n\r\n### Update a package\r\n\r\n1. Search for the appropriate recipe.\r\n2. Fork the recipe you wish to update.\r\n3. Edit the recipe.\r\n4. Propose the change as a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Add a recipe\r\n",
